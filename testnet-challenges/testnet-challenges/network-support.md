While validators and other network components are not necessarily targeted in this testnet, they are of course essential to maintaining a healthy DeCloud.

Leverage this testnet to practice your operations, or try new ones.

To earn rewards for this challenge, you should be actively participating â€” keep your component\(s\) up-to-date and respond to any network proposals that may come up.

Although we do not limit anyone from participating, to claim AKT rewards:

* You must not be a resident of any of the OFAC sanctioned countries.
