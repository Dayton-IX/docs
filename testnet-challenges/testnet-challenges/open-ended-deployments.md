# Open-Ended Deployments

{% hint style="warning" %}
The incentivized testnet has completed - there are no more challenges to earn rewards from.

Thank you for your interest; stay tuned for more opportunities to participate in the future!

As a generic cloud platform, Akash DeCloud has the potential to be used in a wide variety of use cases. This open-ended challenge is meant to explore what kinds of applications can be deployed on DeCloud, and how.

Youâ€™ll support the Akash DeCloud community by finding unique applications to deploy and sharing your deployment configuration via a pull request on [Awesome Akash](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash).

## Unique App Submission

**Instructions** for adding a **new** app:

1\) Sign up to Akash [Testnet](https://app.akash.network).

2\) Create an [SDL](../../documentation/sdl.md) for your application and use the [deploy guides](https://github.com/ovrclk/docs/tree/7d988371c4b3ebbb350ce65c58f6ca1615250e5a/guides/deploy.md) to deploy it.

4\) Fork the [Awesome Akash Repository](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash).

5\) Clone the ecosystem repository to your workstation. For example, where `<user>` is your GitHub username:

```text
  git clone https://github.com/<user>/awesome-akash.git
```

6\) Create a directory for your app in the `awesome-akash` repository.

1. Add your [SDL](../../documentation/sdl.md) file to the directory for your application.
2. Add a `README.md` to your application directory that describes your application and any special instructions needed for deploying it.
3. Add your app to the list of applications in the main [`README.md`](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash/blob/master/README.md)

7\) Commit your code; include your **Participation ID** from [Testnet](https://app.akash.network) in the body of the commit message.

8\) Send a pull request to [Awesome Akash Repository](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash). Include your **Participation ID** from [Testnet](https://app.akash.network) in the title of the pull request like so:

> ID dgbfr0rugcxnyuu: Add Lunie-Lite to DeFi apps

The body of the PR should include instructions for verifying your app. In most cases, including a link to your deployed app will suffice. To ensure that all the information is present, include the output of `akash provider lease-status`.

Tag your PR with the appropriate app category.

Please see [this](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash/pull/22) for an example of a well-formed pull request.

9\) We will review and visit your app and merge the PR when it has been verified. When your PR has been merged you may close the deployment \(see [guides](https://github.com/ovrclk/docs/tree/7d988371c4b3ebbb350ce65c58f6ca1615250e5a/guides/deploy.md) for instructions on closing deployments\).

## Verify App Submission

**Instructions** for verifying an **existing** app:

1\) Sign up to Akash [Testnet](https://app.akash.network).

2\) Use an [SDL](../../documentation/sdl.md) from an existing application in [Awesome Akash](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash) and follow the [deploy guides](https://github.com/ovrclk/docs/tree/7d988371c4b3ebbb350ce65c58f6ca1615250e5a/guides/deploy.md) to deploy it.

3\) Create an issue [here](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash/issues/new) with the following properties:

* The title should be `ID: <participation-id> verify <app-name>`.
* The body should have the output of  `akashctl provider lease-status` for your deployment.
* Add the label `kind/verification`.

See [here](https://github.com/ovrclk/awesome-akash/issues/24) for a well-formed submission.

4\) We will review and visit your app and close the issue when it has been verified. When your issue has been closed you may close the deployment \(see [guides](https://github.com/ovrclk/docs/tree/7d988371c4b3ebbb350ce65c58f6ca1615250e5a/guides/deploy.md) for instructions on closing deployments\).
